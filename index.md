## Maryam Hasan

I am a senior data scientist. I am interested in developing efficient machine learning and deep learning algorithms that solve challenging problems in natural language processing and natural language understanding. 
I completed my PhD in computer science at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in May, 2021. My advisor was Professor [Elke Rundensteiner] (https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst). My PhD research has been mainly focused on text classification using Machine Learning, Deep Transfer Learning and Natural Language Processing methods. 

My current research focuses on learning from few labeled examples through transfer and semi-supervised learning.
